Quiz 1 Explanation
An estimation of P(w[0],...,w[6]) for the String array w ("he","came","to","my","school","to","study")
was calculated by applying the Markov Assumption to the data in the unigram and bigram files (1grams.txt and 2grams.txt).
Rather than applying the entire Chain Rule, which would require more information than simple unigram and bigram probabilities,
I applied Markov's Assumption to simplify the estimation to simple unigram and bigram data. Although the string array w appears
to be a sentence, I am assuming the string array was put together randomly and ignores conventional grammar structure, thus
making the sequence of words basically independent of each other, thus allowing the application of Markov's Assumption.
To apply Markov's Assumption, the probability of the sequence is simply the unigram probability of the first word multiplied by
the probability of each following word given another word preceding, in other words the bigram probability of word1 before word2.
To do this in code, I simply set the probability p to the unigram of "he", and then used a for loop to multiply p by each
subsequent bigram data of each word in the string array.
